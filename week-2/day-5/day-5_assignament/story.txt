In a quiet forest, a small firefly often wondered if its light made any difference. It saw the moon shining brightly above and thought, Whatâ€™s the point of my tiny glow?
One night, as the firefly wandered through the woods, it heard a faint meow. Following the sound, it found a frightened kitten stuck between the roots of a tree. The kitten was too scared to move in the darkness.
The firefly hesitated but decided to help. It hovered close, its soft glow lighting the way. Slowly, the kitten followed, step by step, until they emerged into a moonlit clearing. The kitten's owner spotted it and scooped it up with joy.
The firefly watched from a distance, its tiny heart swelling with pride. From that night on, it glowed brighter, knowing that even the smallest light could guide someone to safety.
